PyTrajectory is a Python library for trajectory generation for nonlinear control systems.
It relies on solving a boundary value problem (bvp) via a collocation method. It is based
on the scientific work of Graichen, et al. (see references in
[*Background*](https://pytrajectory.readthedocs.org/en/master/guide/background.html) section
of the documentation), but does not depend on proprietary code like Matlabs *bvp4c*.

It is developed at Dresden University of Technology at the 
[Institute for Control Theory](http://www.et.tu-dresden.de/rst/), see also
[other control related software](http://www.tu-dresden.de/rst/software).
